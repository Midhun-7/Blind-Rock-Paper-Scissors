Overview
This project is built for the Inclusive Game Design Challenge, with the goal of creating a fun, accessible, and inclusive gaming experience for children with disabilities or special needs.

ðŸ§  The Idea
We developed a voice-controlled Rock Paper Scissors game designed especially for visually impaired users. Using voice input and audio feedback, the game allows children to play independently without requiring a visual interface. It supports speech recognition for user moves and provides spoken feedback for computer choices and results.

Children with visual impairments

Can be extended to include motor-impaired users (hands-free experience)

Designed with a focus on simplicity, independence, and fun
